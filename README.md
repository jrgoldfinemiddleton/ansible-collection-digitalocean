# Ansible collection: jrgoldfinemiddleton.digitalocean

## Testing locally

You will likely want to set some of the following environment variables, as needed, depending on which `make` targets you will be running.

* `ANSIBLE_COLLECTION_VERSION`
* `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_TOKEN`
* `ANSIBLE_MOLECULE_GROUP`
* `ANSIBLE_MOLECULE_ROLE`
* `ANSIBLE_MOLECULE_SCENARIO`
* `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD`
* `DO_API_TOKEN`
* `DOCKER_CONFIG`
* `DOCKER_IMAGE_EE`
* `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
* `DOCKER_REGISTRY`
* `DOCKER_USERNAME`

Review the [Makefile](https://github.com/jrgoldfinemiddleton/ansible-collection-digitalocean/blob/main/Makefile) to learn what each environment variable is used for.
